When a contact doesn't have an image it's cool to show a colored placeholder with his initials! 
There are other categories on GitHub to set an image placeholder with the contact's initials, but they can't be used inside a Table/Collection View because the background color of the image changes with cell recycle. ðŸ¤”

Don't worry, you can use **AGCInitials** ðŸ˜‰

### Features

- Super easy
- Background colors will remain the same for identical names, so **you can use it in your table/collection view**. ðŸ˜Ž
- You can set your own color palette
- Good test coverage ðŸ’ª

### How to use it - Basic

Import the category 

```objective-c
#import "UIImageView+AGCInitials.h"
```
and then just use it:

```objective-c
[_anImageView agc_setImageWithInitialsFromName:@"Mick Jagger" separatedByString:@" "];
```
The image will contain a placeholder with the initials "MJ" and a generated background color.

### How to use it - Details

If you want you can **customize the font** by specifying the text attributes:

```objective-c
NSDictionary* initialsTextAttributes = @{ NSFontAttributeName : [UIFont systemFontOfSize:20], NSForegroundColorAttributeName : [UIColor purpleColor] };
[cellImageView agc_setImageWithInitialsFromName:@"Mick Jagger" separatedByString:@" " withTextAttributes:initialsTextAttributes];
```

You can also customize the **color palette** used to generate background colors:

```objective-c
#import "AGCInitialsColors.h"
```

And then just set your palette before using the category:

```objective-c
NSArray<UIColor*>* yourColorPalette; //...
[[AGCInitialsColors sharedInstance] setColorPalette:yourColorPalette];
```
