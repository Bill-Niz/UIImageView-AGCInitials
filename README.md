## Why

When you are displaying contacts in your app it's cool to show a colored placeholder with the contact's initials!

There are other categories on Github to set an image placeholder with the initials of a contact, but they can't' be used inside a Table View because the background color change with cell recycle. ðŸ¤”

With **AGCInitials** it's super-easy to set the image placeholder with the contact's initials and background colors will remain the same for identical names, so you can use it in your table/collection view. ðŸ˜Ž

Plus: good test coverage! ðŸ’ª

## Requirements

iOS 7+

## Installation with Cocoapods

UIImageView-AGCInitials is available through [CocoaPods](http://cocoapods.org). To install
it, simply add the following line to your Podfile:

```ruby
pod "UIImageView-AGCInitials"
```

## Installation without Cocoapods

Copy and paste **AGCInitialsColors.h/m** and **UIImageView+AGCInitials.h/m** classes into your project.

## How to use it - Basic

Import the category 

```objective-c
#import "UIImageView+AGCInitials.h"
```
and then it's just one line of code:

```objective-c
[_anImageView agc_setImageWithInitialsFromName:@"Mick Jagger" separatedByString:@" "];
```
The image will contain a placeholder with the initials "MJ" and a generated background color.

## How to use it - Details

If you want you can **customize the font** by specifying the text attributes:

```objective-c
NSDictionary* initialsTextAttributes = @{ NSFontAttributeName : [UIFont systemFontOfSize:20], NSForegroundColorAttributeName : [UIColor purpleColor] };
[cellImageView agc_setImageWithInitialsFromName:@"Mick Jagger" separatedByString:@" " withTextAttributes:initialsTextAttributes];
```

You can also customize the color palette used to generate background colors:

```objective-c
#import "AGCInitialsColors.h"
```

And then just set your palette before using the category:

```objective-c
NSArray<UIColor*>* yourColorPalette; //...
[[AGCInitialsColors sharedInstance] setColorPalette:yourColorPalette];
```

## Run the example 

To run the example project, clone the repo, and run `pod install` from the Example directory first.
